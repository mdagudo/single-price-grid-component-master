## My process

This is my first challenge using Mobile First Design and rem units in everything, so yeah.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I think I learned the MOST in this challenge. I thought: Hmm, this looks simple, let's LEARN about Mobile First design with this one. Then, I realized the issues when I zoom in my pages, and that lead me to investigate about rem units and actually apply them to all my design. 

### Continued development

I NEED to keep learning how to use rem units in everything and if that makes my pages responsive. When I started these challenges, I had issues when I zoom in the pages, there was overflow in everything. I've been looking other people's codes and I realized they use rem units. I don't even know how to use them, but now I feel like I need to use them in order to achieve that goal of building a responsive page.

### Useful resources
